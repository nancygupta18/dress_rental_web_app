### Dress Rental Web Application

The **Dress Rental Web Application** is a full-stack web platform designed to provide users with a convenient way to browse, book, and rent dresses online for various occasions such as weddings, parties, and traditional events. The system aims to replace the hassle of buying expensive outfits by offering affordable rental options through a user-friendly interface.

The application allows users to explore dresses by category, view detailed product information including images and rental prices, and place rental orders for a selected number of days. User authentication is implemented to enable secure login and personalized experiences such as auto-filling user details during checkout. The rental cost is dynamically calculated based on the number of rental days, with additional charges applied for urgent delivery.

An admin module is included to manage dress listings, upload main and multiple additional images, and maintain rental data efficiently. Images are handled using file upload functionality and stored securely on the server, while metadata is managed through a relational database.

The backend is developed using **Node.js and Express.js**, following an MVC-like structure, while **PostgreSQL** is used for robust and structured data storage. **EJS** is used for server-side rendering of dynamic web pages, and sessions are managed using `express-session` for maintaining login state. The project demonstrates practical implementation of CRUD operations, authentication, database relationships, and real-world rental business logic.

This project showcases my skills in **full-stack web development**, backend logic design, database integration, and building scalable web applications suitable for real-world use cases.
